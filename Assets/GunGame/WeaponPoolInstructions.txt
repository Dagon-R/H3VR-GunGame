Weapon pools:
To make the weapon pool show up, the only thing You need is a json file. All the stuff like buttons to choose will be created automatically. 
If You have the project ready, build it normally like any other map, and then just copy paste json files into the zip file containing the map. 
These weapon pools will be available by default.
